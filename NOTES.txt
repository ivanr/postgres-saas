TODO
====

- User expiration date.

- Service accounts are like user accounts, except that they're not attached to individuals.

- User accounts can be owned by a tenant, or they can exist separately. For example,
  service accounts are always owned by tenants.

- Personal service account or access token. Limited subaccount with separate authentication
  and configured permissions, but shared identity with the parent account.

  - Track purpose.

  - Should personal service accounts be tenant specific? Or specify which tenants to acces.

  - Inherit all permissions vs give only selected permissions.

  - Permissions have to be checked twice, first on the subaccount then on the
    main account. Either that, or trim subaccount permissions as permissions are
    changed on the main account.
