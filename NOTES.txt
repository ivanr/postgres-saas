TODO
====

- Flyway

  - Model in one subproject, database code in second, schema in third

  - Embed the above in the application as needed

  - Standalone CLI to run Flyway w/picocli


- User expiration date.

- Service accounts are like user accounts, except that they're not attached to individuals.

- User accounts can be owned by a tenant, or they can exist separately. For example,
  service accounts are always owned by tenants.

- Personal service account or access token. Limited subaccount with separate authentication
  and configured permissions, but shared identity with the parent account.

  - Track purpose.

  - Should personal service accounts be tenant specific? Or specify which tenants to acces.

  - Inherit all permissions vs give only selected permissions.

  - Permissions have to be checked twice, first on the subaccount then on the
    main account. Either that, or trim subaccount permissions as permissions are
    changed on the main account.


- Row level security

  - Write a generic set of functions that can be reused and/or built on


- Job scheduling

  - created_on
  - last_successful_run
  - last_run -- including failures
  - next_run
  - next_attempt
  - failed_attempts (since the last success)
  - priority -- integer from 0 to 10, default 5
  - status -- healthy, failed
  - status_message
  - duration statistics: last duration, averages in the last M, N, P periods, total runs, total time

  + Scheduling metadata, for example: fixed rate, fixed delay, interval, cron schedule,
       how to reschedule after failures, etc

  + How do we know when to schedule a job in relation to other jobs? A job
    may have some resource requirements and compete with other jobs?

  + We also need to know what the job is. This will sometimes be understood
    from the context, but if we're building a generic job scheduling feature,
    we need some more information. For example:

    - type
    - input -- probably as JSON
    - input_bytes -- if we need binary data; JSON is inefficient for that

  + We probably want to support multiple queues, but those should probably be implemented
    as separate tables using Postgres inheritance.

  + Use partitioning to minimise bloat; can partman should be able to be configured
    to drop partitions only if they're empty?

  + If not using partitioning, bloat can be fixed by copying the data into a temporary
    table, running truncate, then copying the data back.

  + Do we want to keep a record of job attempts and invocations? How about job results?
    Probably in a separate table where we can have custom retention rules.
