Docker
======

Start container in foreground for the first
time to observe there will be no errors:

  # docker-compose up

Start containers:

  # docker-compose up -d

Stop containers:

  # docker-compose down

Remove docker and volumes:

 # docker-compose down -v

Delete all images

 # docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)

Monitor Postgres logs:

 # docker logs -f pg-database

Connect to the database:

 # psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 55432 -U postgres "dbname=saas options=--search_path=main"


Flyway
======

  # ./gradlew :schema:flywayClean
  # ./gradlew :schema:flywayMigrate

Please note that M0__Setup.sql is only used when the containers are
initially created. If this file is changed, the containers will need
to be recreated.

Also, invoking clean won't reset the partman configuration. A better
way to clean is to remove the docker values, then start them back again.


MacPorts
========

# sudo port select --list postgresql
# sudo port select --set  postgresql postgresql16
